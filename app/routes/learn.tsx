      <p>Welcome to the fascinating world of Sierpinski Shapes!</p>
      <p>They&lsquo;re a wonderful combination of math and beauty.</p>
      <p>
        The math is so simple, it&lsquo;s not really even math — you can create Sierpinski Shapes with squares of paper
        and a pair of scissors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty comes from from the infinite variations and the way in which they mimic how the patterns in nature
        form — like plants and shorelines and clouds.
      </p>
      <p>The well known Sierpinski Triangle is just one of those 17 billion Sierpinski Shapes.</p>
