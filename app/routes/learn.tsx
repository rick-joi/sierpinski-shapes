        Welcome to the <strong>beautiful</strong> <strong>math</strong> of Sierpinski Shapes!
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>math</strong> is so simple, it&rsquo;s not really even math — you can create Sierpinski Shapes with
        squares of paper and a pair of scissors.
      </p>

        The <strong>beauty</strong> comes from from the infinite variations and the way in which they mimic how the
        patterns in nature form — like plants and shorelines and clouds.
